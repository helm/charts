# Apache Kafka Helm Chart

This is an implementation of Kafka StatefulSet found here:

 * https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka

## Pre Requisites:

* Kubernetes 1.3 with alpha APIs enabled and support for storage classes

* PV support on underlying infrastructure

* Requires at least `v2.0.0-beta.1` version of helm to support
  dependency management with requirements.yaml

## StatefulSet Details

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/

## StatefulSet Caveats

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#limitations

## Chart Details

This chart will do the following:

* Implement a dynamically scalable kafka cluster using Kubernetes StatefulSets

* Implement a dynamically scalable zookeeper cluster as another Kubernetes StatefulSet required for the Kafka cluster above

* Expose Kafka protocol endpoints via NodePort services (optional)

### Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-kafka` in the default
namespace:

```
$ helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
$ helm install --name my-kafka incubator/kafka
```

If using a dedicated namespace(recommended) then make sure the namespace
exists with:

```
$ kubectl create ns kafka
$ helm install --name my-kafka --set global.namespace=kafka incubator/kafka
```

This chart includes a ZooKeeper chart as a dependency to the Kafka
cluster in its `requirement.yaml` by default. The chart can be customized using the
following configurable parameters:

Specify parameters using `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`

Alternatively a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided like this:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-kafka -f values.yaml incubator/kafka
```

### Connecting to Kafka from inside Kubernetes

You can connect to Kafka by running a simple pod in the K8s cluster like this with a configuration like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: testclient
  namespace: kafka
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kafka
    image: solsson/kafka:0.11.0.0
    command:
      - sh
      - -c
      - "exec tail -f /dev/null"
```

Once you have the testclient pod above running, you can list all kafka
topics with:

` kubectl -n kafka exec -ti testclient -- ./bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper
my-release-zookeeper:2181 --list`

Where `my-release` is the name of your helm release.

## Extensions

Kafka has a rich ecosystem, with lots of tools. This sections is intended to compile all of those tools for which a corresponding Helm chart has already been created.

- [Schema-registry](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/incubator/schema-registry) -  A confluent project that provides a serving layer for your metadata. It provides a RESTful interface for storing and retrieving Avro schemas.

### Connecting to Kafka from outside Kubernetes

Review and optionally override to enable the example text concerned with external access in `values.yaml`.

Once configured, you should be able to reach Kafka via NodePorts, one per replica. In kops where private,
topology is enabled, this feature publishes an internal round-robin DNS record using the following naming
scheme. The external access feature of this chart was tested with kops on AWS using flannel networking.
If you wish to enable external access to Kafka running in kops, your security groups will likely need to
be adjusted to allow non-Kubernetes nodes (e.g. bastion) to access the Kafka external listener port range.

```
{{ .Release.Name }}.{{ .Values.external.domain }}
```

Port numbers for external access used at container and NodePort are unique to each container in the StatefulSet.
Using the default `external.firstListenerPort` number with a `replicas` value of `3`, the following
container and NodePorts will be opened for external access: `31090`, `31091`, `31092`. All of these ports should
be reachable from any host to NodePorts are exposed because Kubernetes routes each NodePort from entry node
to pod/container listening on the same port (e.g. `31091`).

The `external.servicePort` at each external access service (one such service per pod) is a relay toward
the a `containerPort` with a number matching its respective `NodePort`. The range of NodePorts is set, but
should not actually listen, on all Kafka pods in the StatefulSet. As any given pod will listen only one
such port at a time, setting the range at every Kafka pod is a reasonably safe configuration.

## Known Limitations

* Topic creation is not automated
* Only supports storage options that have backends for persistent volume claims (tested mostly on AWS)
* There must not exist a service called `kafka` in the same namespace
