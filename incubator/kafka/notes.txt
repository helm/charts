You can connect to Kafka by running a simple pod in the K8s cluster like this with a configuration like this:

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: testclient
    namespace: kafka
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: kafka
      image: solsson/kafka:0.10.0.1
      command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - "exec tail -f /dev/null"

  Once you have the testclient pod above running, you can list all kafka
  topics with:

  kubectl exec testclient -- ./bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper
  my-release-zk:2181 --list

  Where my-release is the name of your helm release.
