incubator/docker-registry is deprecated

See stable/docker-registry

Note: incubator/docker-registry was previously moved from incubator to stable before a deprecated version was published to this helm repo. Therefore, in order to remove the old versions from aggregators such as Helm Hub (https://hub.helm.sh) and Artifact Hub (https://artifacthub.io/) we have re-added this placeholder deprecated chart. See https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/23128 for further details.
