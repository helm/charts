== Helm Example for Crunchy Postgres

This is an example of running the Crunchy Postgres containers
using the link://https://github.com/kubernetes/helm[Helm project]!  More examples of the Crunchy Containers
for Postgres can be found at the link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/[github site].   This example will live eventually within the 
Kubernetes Chart project contributed link:https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/[examples].

This example will create the following in your Kubernetes cluster:

 * postgres master service
 * postgres replica service
 * postgres 9.5 master database (pod)
 * postgres 9.5 replica database (replication controller)

This example creates a simple Postgres streaming replication 
deployment with a master (read-write), and a single asyncronous
replica (read-only).  You can scale up the number of replicas
dynamically.

=== Installation

Install helm according to their github documentation
and then install the examples as follows:
....
helm install ./crunchy-postgres-cluster
....

=== Testing

After installing the Helm chart, you will see the following services:
....
kubectl get services
NAME              CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
crunchy-master    10.0.0.171   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
crunchy-replica   10.0.0.31    <none>        5432/TCP   1h
kubernetes        10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP    1h
....


It takes about a minute for the replica to begin replicating with the
master.  To test out replication, see if replication is underway
with this command, enter *password* for the password when prompted:
....
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

If you see a line returned from that query it means the master is replicating
to the slave.  Try creating some data on the master:

....
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
....

Then verify that the data is replicated to the slave:
....
psql -h crunchy-replica -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....

You can scale up the number of read-only replicas by running
the following kubernetes command:
....
kubectl scale rc crunchy-replica --replicas=2
....

It takes 60 seconds for the replica to start and begin replicating
from the master.
