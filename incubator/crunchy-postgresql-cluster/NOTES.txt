=== Testing

After installing the Helm chart, you will see the following services:
....
kubectl get services
NAME              CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
crunchy-master    10.0.0.171   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
crunchy-replica   10.0.0.31    <none>        5432/TCP   1h
kubernetes        10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP    1h
....

It takes about a minute for the replica to begin replicating with the
master.  To test out replication, see if replication is underway
with this command, enter *password* for the password when prompted:
....
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

If you see a line returned from that query it means the master is replicating
to the slave.  Try creating some data on the master:

....
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
....

Then verify that the data is replicated to the slave:
....
psql -h crunchy-replica -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....

You can scale up the number of read-only replicas by running
the following kubernetes command:
....
kubectl scale deployment crunchy-replica --replicas=2
....

It takes 60 seconds for the replica to start and begin replicating
from the master.
