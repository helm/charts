=== Setup

The example uses NFS for a Persistent Volume.  To run the example,
you would need access to an NFS server.  The IP address of the NFS
server is specified in values.yaml along with the NFS file path.

=== Testing

After installing the Helm chart, you will see the following services:
....
kubectl get services
NAME              CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
crunchy-master    10.0.0.171   <none>        5432/TCP   1h
crunchy-replica   10.0.0.31    <none>        5432/TCP   1h
kubernetes        10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP    1h
....

It takes about a minute for the replica to begin replicating with the
master.  To test out replication, see if replication is underway
with this command, enter *password* for the password when prompted:
....
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

If you see a line returned from that query it means the master is replicating
to the slave.  Try creating some data on the master:

....
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'create table foo (id int)'
psql -h crunchy-master -U postgres postgres -c 'insert into foo values (1)'
....

Then verify that the data is replicated to the slave:
....
psql -h crunchy-replica -U postgres postgres -c 'table foo'
....

You can scale up the number of read-only replicas by running
the following kubernetes command:
....
kubectl scale deployment crunchy-replica --replicas=2
....

It takes 60 seconds for the replica to start and begin replicating
from the master.
