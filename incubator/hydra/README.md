# Hydra
[Hydra](https://github/ory/hdya) offers OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Core 1.0 capabilities as a service. Hydra is different, because it works with any existing authentication infrastructure, not just LDAP or SAML. By implementing a consent app (works with any programming language) you build a bridge between Hydra and your authentication infrastructure.

Hydra is able to securely manage JSON Web Keys, and has a sophisticated policy-based access control you can use if you want to.

This chart comes bundled with an installation of Postgres.

# Prerequesites

* Persistent volume provisioner to support in the underlying infrastructure

# Install

To install the chart:

```
helm install --name=my-release-name stable/hydra
```

This will create a deployment, a secret, a service, and optionally a PersistentVolumeClaim, prefixed with `my-release-name`.

# Uninstall

```
helm delete my-release-name [--purge]
```

Adding the `--purge` flag will completely remove any trace of your release. (No values will be remembered.)
