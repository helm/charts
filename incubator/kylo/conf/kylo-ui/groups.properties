## The maximum number of starting flow files per feed during the given run interval to send to ops manager
kylo.provenance.max.starting.events=5
## The number of starting flow files allowed to be sent through until the throttle mechanism in engaged.
# if the feed starting processor gets more than this number of events during a rolling window based upon the kylo.provenance.event.throttle.threshold.time.millis timefame events will be throttled back to 1 per second until its slowed down
kylo.provenance.event.count.throttle.threshold=15
## Throttle timefame used to check the rolling window to determine if rapid fire is occurring
kylo.provenance.event.throttle.threshold.time.millis=1000
## run interval to gather stats and send to ops manager
kylo.provenance.run.interval.millis=3000
## JSON string of the Event Type to Array of Processor classes
## These processors produce orphan child flow files that dont send DROP provenance events for the children.
## Child flow files produced by events  matching the EventType and processor class will not be processed
