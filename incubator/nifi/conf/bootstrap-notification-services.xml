    <!-- This file is used to define how interested parties are notified when events in NiFi's lifecycle occur. -->
    <!-- The format of this file is:
        <services>
            <service>
                <id>service-identifier</id>
                <class>org.apache.nifi.notifications.DesiredNotificationService</class>
                <property name="property name">property value</property>
                <property name="another property">another property value</property>
            </service>
        </services>

        This file can contain 0 to many different service definitions.
        The id can then be referenced from the bootstrap.conf file in order to configure the notification service
        to be used when particular lifecycle events occur.
