        - Legacy Authorized Users File - The full path to an existing authorized-users.xml that will be automatically

            associates them with a group. The value of that user attribute could be a dn or group name for instance. What value is expected

        'User Group Name Attribute - Referenced Group Attribute' - If blank, the value of the attribute defined in 'User Group Name Attribute'
            is expected to be the full dn of the group. If not blank, this property will define the attribute of the group ldap entry that
            the value of the attribute defined in 'User Group Name Attribute' is referencing (i.e. name). Use of this property requires that

            is configured in the 'Group Member Attribute - Referenced User Attribute'. (i.e. member: cn=User 1,ou=users,o=nifi vs. memberUid: user1)

            users and groups for use in the managed access policies.
        - Authorizations File - The file where the FileAccessPolicyProvider will store policies.
        - Initial Admin Identity - The identity of an initial admin user that will be granted access to the UI and

            a DN when using certificates or LDAP, or a Kerberos principal. This property will only be used when there
