        The FileUserGroupProvider will provide support for managing users and groups which is backed by a file

        - Users File - The file where the FileUserGroupProvider will store users and groups.
        - Legacy Authorized Users File - The full path to an existing authorized-users.xml that will be automatically
            be used to load the users and groups into the Users File.
        - Initial User Identity [unique key] - The identity of a users and systems to seed the Users File. The name of

        'User Group Name Attribute' - Attribute to use to define group membership (i.e. memberof). Optional. If not set
            group membership will not be calculated through the users. Will rely on group membership being defined
            through 'Group Member Attribute' if set. The value of this property is the name of the attribute in the user ldap entry that
            associates them with a group. The value of that user attribute could be a dn or group name for instance. What value is expected
            is configured in the 'User Group Name Attribute - Referenced Group Attribute'.
        'User Group Name Attribute - Referenced Group Attribute' - If blank, the value of the attribute defined in 'User Group Name Attribute'
            is expected to be the full dn of the group. If not blank, this property will define the attribute of the group ldap entry that
            the value of the attribute defined in 'User Group Name Attribute' is referencing (i.e. name). Use of this property requires that
            'Group Search Base' is also configured.

            associates them with a user. The value of that group attribute could be a dn or memberUid for instance. What value is expected
            is configured in the 'Group Member Attribute - Referenced User Attribute'. (i.e. member: cn=User 1,ou=users,o=nifi vs. memberUid: user1)
        'Group Member Attribute - Referenced User Attribute' - If blank, the value of the attribute defined in 'Group Member Attribute'

        - Authorizations File - The file where the FileAccessPolicyProvider will store policies.
        - Initial Admin Identity - The identity of an initial admin user that will be granted access to the UI and

            a DN when using certificates or LDAP, or a Kerberos principal. This property will only be used when there
