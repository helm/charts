        'TLS - Keystore' - Path to the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Keystore Password' - Password for the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP
            using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Keystore Type' - Type of the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP using
            LDAPS or START_TLS (i.e. JKS or PKCS12).
        'TLS - Truststore' - Path to the Truststore that is used when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Truststore Password' - Password for the Truststore that is used when connecting to
            LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Truststore Type' - Type of the Truststore that is used when connecting to LDAP using
            LDAPS or START_TLS (i.e. JKS or PKCS12).
        'TLS - Client Auth' - Client authentication policy when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
            Possible values are REQUIRED, WANT, NONE.
        'TLS - Protocol' - Protocol to use when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS. (i.e. TLS,
            TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, etc).
        'TLS - Shutdown Gracefully' - Specifies whether the TLS should be shut down gracefully 
            before the target context is closed. Defaults to false.
            
        'Referral Strategy' - Strategy for handling referrals. Possible values are FOLLOW, IGNORE, THROW.
        'Connect Timeout' - Duration of connect timeout. (i.e. 10 secs).
        'Read Timeout' - Duration of read timeout. (i.e. 10 secs).
       
        'Url' - Space-separated list of URLs of the LDAP servers (i.e. ldap://<hostname>:<port>).
        'User Search Base' - Base DN for searching for users (i.e. CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com).
        'User Search Filter' - Filter for searching for users against the 'User Search Base'.
            (i.e. sAMAccountName={0}). The user specified name is inserted into '{0}'.
        'Identity Strategy' - Strategy to identify users. Possible values are USE_DN and USE_USERNAME.
            The default functionality if this property is missing is USE_DN in order to retain
            backward compatibility. USE_DN will use the full DN of the user entry if possible.
            USE_USERNAME will use the username the user logged in with.
        'Authentication Expiration' - The duration of how long the user authentication is valid
            for. If the user never logs out, they will be required to log back in following
            this duration.
