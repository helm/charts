TO verify all deployments are running use the below command

    kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep {release_name}

We should get similar output like given below, where three deployments for controller, admission, scheduler should be running.


NAME                       READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  AGE
{release_name}-admission    1/1    1           1          4s
{release_name}-controllers  1/1    1           1          4s
{release_name}-scheduler    1/1    1           1          4s
