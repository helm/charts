We'll need to wait a few seconds for the Neo4j cluster to form.
We need to see this line in all of our pods' logs:

> Remote interface available at http://neo-helm-neo4j-core-2.neo-helm-neo4j.default.svc.cluster.local:7474/

We can see the content of the logs by running the following command:

kubectl logs -l "app={{ template "neo4j.name" . }},component=core"

We can now run a query to find the topology of the cluster.

kubectl run -it --rm cypher-shell \
    --image=neo4j:3.2.3-enterprise \
    --restart=Never \
    --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
    --command -- ./bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <password> --a {{ printf "%s-%s" .Release.Name .Values.name | trunc 56 }}.default.svc.cluster.local "call dbms.cluster.overview()"

This will print out the addresses of the members of the cluster.

Note:
You'll need to substitute <password> with the password you set when installing the Helm package.
If you didn't set a password, one will be auto generated.
You can find the base64 encoded version of the password by running the following command:

kubectl get secrets {{ template "neo4j.secrets.fullname" . }} -o yaml
