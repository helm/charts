CockroachDB can be accessed via port 26257 (or whatever you set the GrpcPort
value to) at the following DNS name from within your cluster:
{{ .Release.Name }}-public.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local

Because CockroachDB supports the PostgreSQL wire protocol, you can connect to
the cluster using any available PostgreSQL client.

For example, you can open up a SQL shell to the cluster by running:

    kubectl run -it --rm cockroach-client \
        --image=cockroachdb/cockroach \
        --restart=Never \
        --command -- ./cockroach sql --host {{ printf "%s-%s" .Release.Name .Values.Name | trunc 56 }}-public.{{ .Release.Namespace }}

From there, you can interact with the SQL shell as you would any other SQL shell,
confident that any data you write will be safe and available even if parts of
your cluster fail.

Finally, to open up the CockroachDB admin UI, you can port-forward from your
local machine into one of the instances in the cluster:

    kubectl port-forward {{ printf "%s-%s" .Release.Name .Values.Name | trunc 56 }}-0 8080

Then you can access the admin UI at http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser.
