## Configure the ingress resource that allows you to access the
## Grav installation. Set up the URL
## ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress/
##
ingress:
  ## Set to true to enable ingress record generation
  enabled: false

  ## The list of hostnames to be covered with this ingress record.
  ## Most likely this will be just one host, but in the event more hosts are needed, this is an array
  hosts:
  - name: grav.local

    ## Set this to true in order to enable TLS on the ingress record
    ## A side effect of this will be that the backend Grav service will be connected at port 443
    tls: false

    ## If TLS is set to true, you must declare what secret will store the key/certificate for TLS
    tlsSecret: grav.local-tls

    ## Ingress annotations done as key:value pairs
    ## If you're using kube-lego, you will want to add:
    ## kubernetes.io/tls-acme: true
    ##
    ## For a full list of possible ingress annotations, please see
    ## ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/annotations.md
    ##
    ## If tls is set to true, annotation ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: "true" will automatically be set
    annotations:
    #  kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    #  kubernetes.io/tls-acme: true

  secrets:
  ## If you're providing your own certificates, please use this to add the certificates as secrets
  ## key and certificate should start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- or
  ## -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ##
  ## name should line up with a tlsSecret set further up
  ## If you're using kube-lego, this is unneeded, as it will create the secret for you if it is not set
  ##
  ## It is also possible to create and manage the certificates outside of this helm chart
  ## Please see README.md for more information
  # - name: grav.local-tls

resources: {}
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  # limits:
  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 128Mi
  # requests:
  #  cpu: 100m

## Enable persistence using Persistent Volume Claims
## ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/
##
persistence:
  enabled: true
  ## grav data Persistent Volume Storage Class
  ## If defined, storageClassName: <storageClass>
  ## If set to "-", storageClassName: "", which disables dynamic provisioning
  ## If undefined (the default) or set to null, no storageClassName spec is
  ##   set, choosing the default provisioner.  (gp2 on AWS, standard on
  ##   GKE, AWS & OpenStack)
  ##
  # storageClass: "-"

  ## If you want to reuse an existing claim, you can pass the name of the PVC using
  ## the existingClaim variable
