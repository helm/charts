# Portworx

[Portworx](https://portworx.com/) is a software defined persistent storage solution designed and purpose built for applications deployed as containers, via container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, Marathon and Swarm. It is a clustered block storage solution and provides a Cloud-Native layer from which containerized stateful applications programmatically consume block, file and object storage services directly through the scheduler.

## Pre-requisites
The helm chart (portworx-helm) deploys Portworx and STork(https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/stork.html) on your Kubernetes cluster. The minimum requirements for deploying the helm chart are as follows:

- Helm has been installed on the client machine from where you would install the chart. (https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm)
- Tiller is running on the Kubernetes cluster where you wish to deploy Portworx. 
- Tiller has been provided with the right RBAC permissions for the chart to be deployed correctly. 
- Kubernetes 1.7+
- All [Pre-requisites](https://docs.portworx.com/#minimum-requirements). for Portworx fulfilled. 

Provide tiller the right RBAC permissions. The chart's pre and post delete hooks use the service account name as `tiller` to clean up resources.
```
kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
kubectl patch deploy --namespace kube-system tiller-deploy -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccount":"tiller"}}}}'
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` run the following commands substituting relevant values for your setup:

##### NOTE: 
`etcdEndPoint` is a required field. The chart installation would not proceed unless this option is provided.
If the etcdcluster being used is a secured ETCD (SSL/TLS) then please follow instructions to create a kubernetes secret with the certs. https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/etcd-certs-using-secrets.html#create-kubernetes-secret


`clusterName` should be a unique name identifying your Portworx cluster. The default value is `mycluster`, but it is suggested to update it with your naming scheme.  

For eg: 
```
git clone https://github.com/portworx/helm.git
helm install --debug --name my-release --set etcdEndPoint=etcd:http://192.168.70.90:2379,clusterName=$(uuid) ./helm/charts/portworx/
```

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the Portworx chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

> **Tip**: In this case the chart is located at `./helm/charts/px`, do change it as per your setup. 
```
helm install --name my-release --set deploymentType=docker,imageVersion=1.2.12.0,etcdEndPoint=etcd:http://192.168.70.90:2379 ./helm/charts/px/
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,
```
helm install --name my-release -f ./helm/charts/px/values.yaml ./helm/charts/px
```
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml) and make changes as per your requirement

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:
The chart would follow the process as outlined here. (https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/install.html#uninstall)

> **Tip** > The Portworx configuration files under `/etc/pwx/` directory are preserved, and will not be deleted.

```
helm delete my-release
```
The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

### Basic troubleshooting

#### Helm install errors with `no available release name found`

``` 
helm install --dry-run --debug --set etcdEndPoint=etcd:http://192.168.70.90:2379,clusterName=$(uuid) ./helm/charts/px/
[debug] Created tunnel using local port: '37304'
[debug] SERVER: "127.0.0.1:37304"
[debug] Original chart version: ""
[debug] CHART PATH: /root/helm/charts/px

Error: no available release name found
```
This most likely indicates that Tiller doesn't have the right RBAC permissions.
You can verify the tiller logs 
```
[storage/driver] 2018/02/07 06:00:13 get: failed to get "singing-bison.v1": configmaps "singing-bison.v1" is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default" cannot get configmaps in the namespace "kube-system"
[tiller] 2018/02/07 06:00:13 info: generated name singing-bison is taken. Searching again.
[tiller] 2018/02/07 06:00:13 warning: No available release names found after 5 tries
[tiller] 2018/02/07 06:00:13 failed install prepare step: no available release name found
```

#### Helm install errors with  `Job failed: BackoffLimitExceeded`

```
helm install --debug --set dataInterface=eth1,managementInterface=eth1,etcdEndPoint=etcd:http://192.168.70.179:2379,clusterName=$(uuid) ./helm/charts/px/
[debug] Created tunnel using local port: '36389'

[debug] SERVER: "127.0.0.1:36389"

[debug] Original chart version: ""
[debug] CHART PATH: /root/helm/charts/px

Error: Job failed: BackoffLimitExceeded
```
This most likely indicates that the pre-install hook for the helm chart has failed due to a misconfigured or inaccessible ETCD url. 
Follow the below steps to check the reason for failure. 

```
kubectl get pods -nkube-system -a | grep preinstall
px-etcd-preinstall-hook-hxvmb   0/1       Error     0          57s

kubectl logs po/px-etcd-preinstall-hook-hxvmb -nkube-system

Verifying if the provided etcd url is accessible: http://192.168.70.179:2379
Response Code: 000
Incorrect ETCD URL provided. It is either not reachable or is incorrect...

```
Ensure the correct etcd URL is set as a parameter to the `helm install` command. 
```

```
Follow the steps mentioned in the pre-requisites to provide the right RBAC permissions to the serviceaccount running tiller. 

#### Helm install errors with `Job failed: Deadline exceeded`

```
helm install --debug --set dataInterface=eth1,managementInterface=eth1,etcdEndPoint=etcd:http://192.168.20.290:2379,clusterName=$(uuid) ./charts/px/
[debug] Created tunnel using local port: '39771'

[debug] SERVER: "127.0.0.1:39771"

[debug] Original chart version: ""
[debug] CHART PATH: /root/helm/charts/px

Error: Job failed: DeadlineExceeded
```
This error indicates that the pre-install hook for the helm chart has failed to run to completion correctly. Verify that the etcd URL is accessible. This error occurs on kubernetes cluster(s) with version below 1.8 
Follow the below steps to check the reason for failure. 

```
kubectl get pods -nkube-system -a | grep preinstall
px-hook-etcd-preinstall-dzmkl    0/1       Error     0          6m
