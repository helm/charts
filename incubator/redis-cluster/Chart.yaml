description: Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. This chart will allow you to install a redis cluster which allows the ability to reshard keys from one node to another while the cluster is running, together with a failover procedure that makes sure the system is able to survive certain kinds of failures.
