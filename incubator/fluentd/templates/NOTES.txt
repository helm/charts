To verify that Fluentd Elasticsearch has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} get all -l "app={{ template "fluentd.name" . }},release={{ .Release.Name }}"

THIS APPLICATION CAPTURES ALL CONSOLE OUTPUT AND FORWARDS IT TO Elasticsearch. Anything that might be identifying,
including things like IP addresses, container images, and object names will NOT be anonymized.
