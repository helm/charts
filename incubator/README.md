## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add incubator https://charts.helm.sh/incubator
```

You can then run `helm search repo incubator` to see the charts, or browse on CNCF [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?page=1&repo=helm-incubator).
