# Replicas scales the cluster with the "helm upgrade" command
# The recommended etcd cluster size is 3, 5 or 7, which is decided by the fault tolerance requirement.
# A 7-member cluster can provide enough fault tolerance in most cases.
# While larger cluster provides better fault tolerance the write performance reduces since data needs to
# be replicated to more machines.
