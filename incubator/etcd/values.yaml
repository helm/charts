# Replicas scales the cluster with the "helm upgrade" command
# The recommended etcd cluster size is 3, 5 or 7,
# which is decided by the fault tolerance requirement.
# A 7-member cluster can provide enough fault tolerance in most cases.
# While larger cluster provides better fault tolerance the write performance
# reduces since data needs to be replicated to more machines.
