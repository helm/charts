# Elasticsearch Helm Chart

This chart is based on the [centerforopenscience/elasticsearch](https://hub.docker.com/r/centerforopenscience/elasticsearch/) image which comes with Fabric8's great [kubernetes discovery plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/elasticsearch-cloud-kubernetes) for Elasticsearch.
 
## Prerequisites Details

* Kubernetes 1.6+
* PV dynamic provisioning support on the underlying infrastructure

## StatefulSets Details
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/

## StatefulSets Caveats
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#limitations

## Todo

* Implement TLS/Auth/Security
* Smarter upscaling/downscaling
* Solution for memory locking

## Chart Details
This chart will do the following:

* Implemented a dynamically scalable elasticsearch cluster using Kubernetes StatefulSets/Deployments
* Multi-role deployment: master, client (coordinating) and data nodes
* Statefulset Supports scaling down without degrading the cluster

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
$ helm install --name my-release incubator/elasticsearch
```

## Deleting the Charts

Delete the Helm deployment as normal

```
$ helm delete my-release
```

Deletion of the StatefulSet doesn't cascade to deleting associated PVCs. To delete them:

```
$ kubectl delete pvc -l release=my-release,component=data
```

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the elasticsearch chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

In terms of Memory resources you should make sure that you follow that equation:

- `${role}HeapSize < ${role}MemoryRequests < ${role}MemoryLimits`

The YAML value of cluster.config is appended to elasticsearch.yml file for additional customization ("script.inline: on" for example to allow inline scripting)

# Deep dive

## Application Version

This chart aims to support Elasticsearch v2 and v5 deployments by specifying the `values.yaml` parameter `appVersion`.

### Version Specific Features

* Memory Locking *(variable renamed)*
* Ingest Node *(v5)*
* X-Pack Plugin *(v5)*

Upgrade paths & more info: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html

## Mlocking

This is a limitation in kubernetes right now. There is no way to raise the
limits of lockable memory, so that these memory areas won't be swapped. This
would degrade performance heavily. The issue is tracked in
[kubernetes/#3595](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/3595).

```
[WARN ][bootstrap] Unable to lock JVM Memory: error=12,reason=Cannot allocate memory
[WARN ][bootstrap] This can result in part of the JVM being swapped out.
[WARN ][bootstrap] Increase RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, soft limit: 65536, hard limit: 65536
```

## Minimum Master Nodes
> The minimum_master_nodes setting is extremely important to the stability of your cluster. This setting helps prevent split brains, the existence of two masters in a single cluster.

>When you have a split brain, your cluster is at danger of losing data. Because the master is considered the supreme ruler of the cluster, it decides when new indices can be created, how shards are moved, and so forth. If you have two masters, data integrity becomes perilous, since you have two nodes that think they are in charge.

>This setting tells Elasticsearch to not elect a master unless there are enough master-eligible nodes available. Only then will an election take place.

>This setting should always be configured to a quorum (majority) of your master-eligible nodes. A quorum is (number of master-eligible nodes / 2) + 1

More info: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/1.x/_important_configuration_changes.html#_minimum_master_nodes

# Client and Coordinating Nodes

Elasticsearch v5 terminology has updated, and now refers to a `Client Node` as a `Coordinating Node`.

More info: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/modules-node.html#coordinating-node

## Select right storage class for SSD volumes

### GCE + Kubernetes 1.5

Create StorageClass for SSD-PD

```
$ kubectl create -f - <<EOF
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: ssd
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-ssd
EOF
```
Create cluster with Storage class `ssd` on Kubernetes 1.5+

```
$ helm install incubator/elasticsearch --name my-release --set data.storageClass=ssd,data.storage=100Gi
```
