    # The form of each line in this file should be as follows:
    #
    #   output_template (frequency) = method input_pattern
    #
    # This will capture any received metrics that match 'input_pattern'
    # for calculating an aggregate metric. The calculation will occur
    # every 'frequency' seconds and the 'method' can specify 'sum' or
    # 'avg'. The name of the aggregate metric will be derived from
    # 'output_template' filling in any captured fields from 'input_pattern'.
    #
    # For example, if you're metric naming scheme is:
    #
    #   <env>.applications.<app>.<server>.<metric>
    #
    # You could configure some aggregations like so:
    #
    #   <env>.applications.<app>.all.requests (60) = sum <env>.applications.<app>.*.requests
    #   <env>.applications.<app>.all.latency (60) = avg <env>.applications.<app>.*.latency
    #
    # As an example, if the following metrics are received:
    #
    #   prod.applications.apache.www01.requests
    #   prod.applications.apache.www01.requests
    #
    # They would all go into the same aggregation buffer and after 60 seconds the
    # aggregate metric 'prod.applications.apache.all.requests' would be calculated
    # by summing their values.
    #
    # Template components such as <env> will match everything up to the next dot.
    # To match metric multiple components including the dots, use <<metric>> in the
    # input template:
    #
    #   <env>.applications.<app>.all.<app_metric> (60) = sum <env>.applications.<app>.*.<<app_metric>>

  rewrite-rules.conf: |
    # This file defines regular expression patterns that can be used to
    # rewrite metric names in a search & replace fashion. It consists of two
    # sections, [pre] and [post]. The rules in the pre section are applied to
    # metric names as soon as they are received. The post rules are applied
    # after aggregation has taken place.
    #
    # The general form of each rule is as follows:
    #
    # regex-pattern = replacement-text
    #
    # For example:
    #
    # [post]
    # _sum$ =
    # _avg$ =
    #
    # These rules would strip off a suffix of _sum or _avg from any metric names
    # after aggregation.
