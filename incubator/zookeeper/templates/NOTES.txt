Thank you for installing ZooKeeper on your Kubernetes cluster. More information
about ZooKeeper can be found at https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/

1. ZooKeeper is not accessible outside of the Kubernetes cluster. Its purpose is
to provide coordination for distributed systems running inside the cluster. As
ZooKeeper uses a TCP based protocol with an internal wire format, you will
probably want to use an existing client library for communication with the
ensemble.

2. The officially maintained clients are written in C and Java, and these can be
obtained with ZooKeeper release from
http://www-us.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.9/.
A list of language specific bindings and higher level libraries is available
here https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/ZKClientBindings.

3. Most ZooKeeper clients require a connection string when instantiating an
instance of the client library, or when first connecting the client to the
ensemble. The connection string takes the form
<server>:<port>,<server>:<port>,... . If your ensemble has greater than 1
server, you should provide multiple servers in the connection string to allow
for the client to continue to function in the presence of individual server
failures. It is important that you do not use IP addresses and instead use the
DNS entries for the domain established by the StatefulSet's HeadlessService.
Your connection string should look like {{ template "zookeeper.fullname" . }}-headless-0:{{ .Values.ClientPort }},{{ template "zookeeper.fullname" . }}-headless-1:{{ .Values.ClientPort }},...
You can also use the client Service {{ template "zookeeper.fullname" . }}:{{ .Values.ClientPort }} to connect to an available ZooKeeper server.
