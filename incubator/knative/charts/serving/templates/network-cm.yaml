    # This block is not actually functional configuration,

    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration

    # options and document them in a way that is accessible

    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.

    #

    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of

    # this block and unindented to actually change the configuration.


    # istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges specifies the IP ranges that Istio sidecar

    # will intercept.

    #

    # Replace this with the IP ranges of your cluster (see below for some examples).

    # Separate multiple entries with a comma.

    # Example: "10.4.0.0/14,10.7.240.0/20"

    #

    # If set to "*" Istio will intercept all traffic within

    # the cluster as well as traffic that is going outside the cluster.

    # Traffic going outside the cluster will be blocked unless

    # necessary egress rules are created.

    #

    # If omitted or set to "", value of global.proxy.includeIPRanges

    # provided at Istio deployment time is used. In default Knative serving

    # deployment, global.proxy.includeIPRanges value is set to "*".

    #

    # If an invalid value is passed, "" is used instead.

    #

    # If valid set of IP address ranges are put into this value,

    # Istio will no longer intercept traffic going to IP addresses

    # outside the provided ranges and there is no need to specify

    # egress rules.

    #

    # To determine the IP ranges of your cluster:

    #   IBM Cloud Private: cat cluster/config.yaml | grep service_cluster_ip_range

    #   IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: "172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16,10.10.10.0/24"

    #   Google Container Engine (GKE): gcloud container clusters describe XXXXXXX --zone=XXXXXX | grep -e clusterIpv4Cidr -e servicesIpv4Cidr

    #   Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): "10.0.0.0/16"

    #   Azure Container Service (ACS; deprecated): "10.244.0.0/16,10.240.0.0/16"

    #   Azure Container Service Engine (ACS-Engine; OSS): Configurable, but defaults to "10.0.0.0/16"

    #   Minikube: "10.0.0.1/24"

    # clusteringress.class specifies the default cluster ingress class

    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.

    #

    # If not specified, will use the Istio ingress.

    #

    # Note that changing the ClusterIngress class of an existing Route

    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only

    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting

    # undefined behavior.
