    # options and document them in a way that is accessible

    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.

    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of

    # this block and unindented to actually change the configuration.


    # Default Knative Gateway after v0.3. It points to the Istio

    # standard istio-ingressgateway, instead of a custom one that we

    # used pre-0.3.

    # A cluster local gateway to allow pods outside of the mesh to access

    # Services and Routes not exposing through an ingress.  If the users

    # do have a service mesh setup, this isn''t required and can be removed.

    #

    # An example use case is when users want to use Istio without any

    # sidecar injection (like Knative''s istio-lean.yaml).  Since every pod

    # is outside of the service mesh in that case, a cluster-local  service

    # will need to be exposed to a cluster-local gateway to be accessible.
