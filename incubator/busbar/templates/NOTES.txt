The busbar CLI parameters for the newly created cluster are as follow:
- default_git_branch: master
- busbar_profile: {{ .Values.clusterName }}.{{ .Values.privateDomainName }}

For the URL for Busbar API, Kubecofig service and the private Docker Registry,
run the following commands once the services are created:

Busbar API
- kubectl describe svc {{ template "busbar.fullname" . }}-web | grep "LoadBalancer Ingress:" | cut -f 2

Kubeconfig Service
- kubectl describe svc {{ template "kubeConfig.fullname" . }} | grep "LoadBalancer Ingress:" | cut -f 2

Private Docker Registry:
- kubectl describe svc {{ template "kubeRegistry.fullname" . }}-external | grep "LoadBalancer Ingress:" | cut -f 2

Please note that the Kubeconfig service Docker image needs to be built and pushed to your private Docker registry
in order for the service to work. The dockerfile can be found at https://github.com/busbar-io/kubeconfig-server
