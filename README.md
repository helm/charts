# application-dm-templates
Curated applications for Kubernetes using Deployment Manager templates

## Welcome

Welcome to the Kubernetes Template Registry.

This registry holds Deployment Manager
[templates](https://github.com/kubernetes/deployment-manager/tree/master/docs/design/design.md#templates)
that you can use to create, delete and update Kubernetes applications.

For more information about installing and using Deployment Manager, see its
[README.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/deployment-manager/tree/master/README.md).

## Organization

The Kubernetes Template Registry is a standard Deployment Manager template registry.
See
[Template registries](https://github.com/kubernetes/deployment-manager/tree/master/docs/templates/registry.md)
to learn how template registries are organized.

## Usage

The templates in this registry can be accessed directly from the Deployment Manager
command line interface, as described in
[Accessing a template registry](https://github.com/kubernetes/deployment-manager/blob/master/docs/templates/registry.md#accessing-a-template-registry).

They can also be used in configurations and other templates, as described in
[Template references](https://github.com/kubernetes/deployment-manager/blob/master/docs/design/design.md#template-references).

## Contributing

Your contributions are welcome.

We use the same [workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/devel/development.md#git-setup),
[License](LICENSE) and [Contributor License Agreement](CONTRIBUTING.md) as the main Kubernetes repository.

## Status of the Project
