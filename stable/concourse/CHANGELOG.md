## v6.0.0:

- added the ability to create worker only and web-only deployments using `web.enabled` and `worker.enabled`
- **[breaking]** worker and web secrets are now separated into 2 different templates, `worker-secrets.yaml` and `web-secrets.yaml`. Users bringing their own secrets will have to split them into 2 different k8s objects.

# v7.0.0:

- upgraded the PostgreSQL Chart (direct dependency of this Chart) from `0.13.1` to `5.3.8`. As various values (like `postgresUser`) changed (to, for instance, `postgresqlUsername`), a major dump was needed.
