## Problem

Dynamically generating app configuration when kubernetes resources change.

## Solution

A kubernetes operator that can dynamically generate app configuration when kubernetes resources change

## Features

- Render Configurations to
  - ConfigMap
  - Secret
- Support for GO Templating Engine
- Custom helper functions
- Support to watch the following Kubernetes Resources
  - Pods
  - Services
  - Ingresses

## Deploying to Kubernetes

Deploying Konfigurator is a 2 step procedure:

1. Deploy CRD to your cluster
2. Deploy Konfigurator operator

So first apply the CRD manifest by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Konfigurator/master/deploy/crd.yaml
```

Once the CRD is installed, you can deploy the operator on your kubernetes cluster via any of the following methods.

### Helm Charts

if you have configured helm on your cluster, you can add konfigurator to helm from public chart repository and deploy it via helm using below mentioned commands

```bash
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/

helm repo update

helm install stable/konfigurator
```

Once Konfigurator is running, you can start creating resources supported by it. For details about its custom resources, look [here](https://github.com/stakater/Konfigurator/tree/master/docs/konfigurator-template.md).

## Usage

You can set the following properties in KonfiguratorTemplate to customize your generated resource

| Name                           | Description                                                                                                                                                           | Example                                    |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| renderTarget                   | This tells the operator where the underlying rendered config will be stored                                                                                           | `ConfigMap` or `Secret`                    |
| app.name                       | This is the name of your app, it needs to be equal to the name specified in your Deployment, DaemonSet or StatefulSet                                                 | `fluentd`                                  |
| app.Kind                       | This specifies the resource on which your app is running on                                                                                                           | `Deployment`, `DaemonSet` or `StatefulSet` |
| app.volumeMounts               | This is an array which lists where the rendered resource will be mounted                                                                                              |                                            |
| app.volumeMounts.mountPath     | The path inside the container where you want the rendered resource to be mounted                                                                                      | `/home/app/config/`                        |
| app.volumeMounts.containerName | The container name inside which the resource will be mounted                                                                                                          | `my-container`                             |
| app.templates                  | A list of key value pairs. All the configuration templates go inside this property. You can paste your static config as is inside this block and it will work as well | `app.config: someConfig`                   |
