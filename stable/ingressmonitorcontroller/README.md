# ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/IngressMonitorController/master/assets/web/IMC-round-100px.png) Ingress Monitor Controller

A Kubernetes/Openshift controller to watch ingresses/routes and create liveness alerts for your apps/microservices in Uptime checkers.

[![Get started with Stakater](https://stakater.github.io/README/stakater-github-banner.png)](http://stakater.com/?utm_source=IngressMonitorController&utm_medium=github)

## Problem Statement

We want to monitor ingresses in a kubernetes cluster and routes in openshift cluster via any uptime checker but the problem is having to manually check for new ingresses or routes / removed ingresses or routes and add them to the checker or remove them.

## Solution

[IngressMonitorController](https://github.com/stakater/IngressMonitorController) will continuously watch ingresses/routes in specific or all namespaces, and automatically add / remove monitors in any of the uptime checkers. With the help of this solution, you can keep a check on your services and see whether they're up and running and live, without worrying about manually registering them on the Uptime checker.

## Supported Uptime Checkers

Currently we support the following monitors:

- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com)
- [Pingdom](https://pingdom.com) ([Additional Config](https://github.com/stakater/IngressMonitorController/blob/master/docs/pingdom-configuration.md))
- [StatusCake](https://www.statuscake.com) ([Additional Config](https://github.com/stakater/IngressMonitorController/blob/master/docs/statuscake-configuration.md))

## Usage

The following quickstart let's you set up Ingress Monitor Controller to register uptime monitors for ingresses/routes in all namespaces:

1. Update the `values.yaml` and set the following properties

  *Note:* Follow [this](https://github.com/stakater/IngressMonitorController/blob/master/docs/uptimerobot-configuration.md) guide to see how to fetch `alertContacts` from UptimeRobot.

2. Enable for your Ingress/Route

   You will need to add the following annotation on your ingresses/routes so that the controller is able to recognize and monitor it.

   ```yaml
   "monitor.stakater.com/enabled": "true"
   ```

3. Deploy the controller by running the following command:

   ```bash
   helm install --name imc-stakater . --namespace default
   ```
