## In the RBAC API, a role contains rules that represent a set of permissions. Permissions are purely additive
## (there are no "deny" rules). A role can be defined within a namespace (kind: Role) or cluster-wide
## (kind: ClusterRole)
# kind: "ClusterRole"
# kind: "Role"
metadata:
  ## Namespaces are omitted, as cluster roles are not namespaced.
