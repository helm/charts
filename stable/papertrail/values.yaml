daemonset:
  ## This chart supports deploying a logspout or a fluentd daeamonset. For more information on the differences,
  ## visit https://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/configuration/configuring-centralized-logging-from-kubernetes/
  type: logspout

  ## Annotations to add to the DaemonSet's Pods
  # podAnnotations:
  #   scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerations: '[{"key": "example", "value": "foo"}]'
   ## Allow the DaemonSet to schedule on tainted nodes (requires Kubernetes >= 1.6)
  # tolerations: []
   ## Allow the DaemonSet to schedule on selected nodes
  # Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/
  # nodeSelector: {}
   ## Allow the DaemonSet to schedule ussing affinity rules
  # Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity
  # affinity: {}
   ## Allow the DaemonSet to perform a rolling update on helm update
  ## ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/
  # updateStrategy: RollingUpdate

papertrail:
  ## You'll need to set this to the host and port provided in your papertrail destination. You
  ## can find these values at https://papertrailapp.com/account/destinations
  ##
  # host:
  # port:

  ## You can optionally include the name of your cluster or some other meaningful descriptor
  ## in the hostname field. This will be visible when viewing logs from this cluster
  ##
  # hostname: "my-cluster-name"

  fluentd:
    varLogDir: /var/log
    varLibDockerContainersDir: /var/lib/docker/containers

  logspout:
    ## Set existing secret to the name of an existing secret that contains the papertrail-destination key,
    ## This can be created using:
    ## kubectl create secret generic papertrail-destination --from-literal=papertrail-destination=syslog+tls://logsN.papertrailapp.com:XXXXX
    ##
    # existingSecret:

    ## Set to the name of a secret that will be created with the endpoint
    #
    # syslogSecretName: "papertrail-syslog"

    ## When running in logspout mode, the logspout container needs to mount the docker.sock file
    dockerSockPath: /var/run/docker.sock
