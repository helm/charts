# Sysdig Falco

[Sysdig Falco](https://falco.org) is a behavioral activity monitor designed to detect anomalous activity in your applications. You can use Falco to monitor run-time security of your Kubernetes applications and internal components.

To know more about Sysdig Falco have a look at:

## Introduction

This chart adds Falco to all nodes in your cluster using a DaemonSet.

Also provides a Deployment for generating Falco alerts. This is useful for testing purposes.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` run:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release stable/falco
```

After a few seconds, Falco should be running.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`, a release is a name used to track a specific deployment

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```
> **Tip**: Use helm delete --purge my-release to completely remove the release from Helm internal storage

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Falco chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release --set falco.jsonOutput=true stable/falco
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/falco
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Loading custom rules

Falco ships with a nice default ruleset. Is a good starting point but sooner or later we are going to need to add custom rules which fits our needs.

A few days ago [we published several rules](https://github.com/draios/falco-extras) for well known container images.

So the question is: How we can load custom rules in our Falco deployment?

We are going to create a file which contains custom rules so that we can keep it in a Git repository.

```bash
$ cat custom-rules.yaml
```

And the file looks like this one:

```yaml
customRules:
  rules-traefik.yaml: |-
    - macro: traefik_consider_syscalls
      condition: (evt.num < 0)

    - macro: app_traefik
      condition: container and container.image startswith "traefik"

    # Restricting listening ports to selected set

    - list: traefik_allowed_inbound_ports_tcp
      items: [443, 80, 8080]

    - rule: Unexpected inbound tcp connection traefik
      desc: Detect inbound traffic to traefik using tcp on a port outside of expected set
      condition: inbound and evt.rawres >= 0 and not fd.sport in (traefik_allowed_inbound_ports_tcp) and app_traefik
      output: Inbound network connection to traefik on unexpected port (command=%proc.cmdline pid=%proc.pid connection=%fd.name sport=%fd.sport user=%user.name %container.info image=%container.image)
      priority: NOTICE

    # Restricting spawned processes to selected set

    - list: traefik_allowed_processes
      items: ["traefik"]

    - rule: Unexpected spawned process traefik
      desc: Detect a process started in a traefik container outside of an expected set
      condition: spawned_process and not proc.name in (traefik_allowed_processes) and app_traefik
      output: Unexpected process spawned in traefik container (command=%proc.cmdline pid=%proc.pid user=%user.name %container.info image=%container.image)
      priority: NOTICE
```

So next step is to use the custom-rules.yaml file for installing the Falco Helm chart.

```bash
$ helm install --name falco -f custom-rules.yaml stable/falco
```

And we will see in our logs something like:

```bash
Tue Jun  5 15:08:57 2018: Loading rules from file /etc/falco/rules.d/rules-traefik.yaml:
```

And this means that our Falco installation has loaded the rules and is ready to help us.

### Automating the generation of custom-rules.yaml file

Sometimes edit YAML files with multistrings is a bit error prone, so we added a script for automating this step and make your life easier.

This script lives in [falco-extras repository](https://github.com/draios/falco-extras) in the scripts directory.

Imagine that you would like to add rules for your Redis, MongoDB and Traefik containers, you have to:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/draios/falco-extras.git
$ cd falco-extras
$ ./scripts/rules2helm rules/rules-mongo.yaml rules/rules-redis.yaml rules/rules-traefik.yaml > custom-rules.yaml
$ helm install --name falco -f custom-rules.yaml stable/falco
```

And that's all, in a few seconds you will see your pods up and running with MongoDB, Redis and Traefik rules enabled.
