# Your custom rules!
####################

# Add new rules, like this one
# - rule: The program "sudo" is run in a container
#   desc: An event will trigger every time you run sudo in a container
#   condition: evt.type = execve and evt.dir=< and container.id != host and proc.name = sudo
#   output: "Sudo run in container (user=%user.name %container.info parent=%proc.pname cmdline=%proc.cmdline)"
#   priority: ERROR
#   tags: [users, container]

# Or override/append to any rule, macro, or list from the Default Rules
