  logLevel: info

  # Minimum rule priority level to load and run. All rules having a

  # A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
  # rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
  # options:
  #  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
  #    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
  #  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
  #
  # With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
  # an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
  # afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
  # no activity.

  #   - logging (alternate method than syslog):

  #   - send over a network connection:
  #     program: nc host.example.com 80

  # If keep_alive is set to true, the program will be started once and
