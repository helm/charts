  # Minimum log level to include in logs. Note: these levels are
  # separate from the priority field of rules. This refers only to the
  # log level of falco's internal logging. Can be one of "emergency",

  logLevel: info

  # Minimum rule priority level to load and run. All rules having a
  # priority more severe than this level will be loaded/run.  Can be one

  # "info", "debug".
  priority: debug

  # Whether or not output to any of the output channels below is
  # buffered.
  bufferedOutputs: false

  # Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to pass
  # system call information. When falco detects that this buffer is
  # full and system calls have been dropped, it can take one or more of
  # the following actions:
  #   - "ignore": do nothing. If an empty list is provided, ignore is assumed.
  #   - "log": log a CRITICAL message noting that the buffer was full.
  #   - "alert": emit a falco alert noting that the buffer was full.
  #   - "exit": exit falco with a non-zero rc.
  #
  # The rate at which log/alert messages are emitted is governed by a
  # token bucket. The rate corresponds to one message every 30 seconds
  # with a burst of 10 messages.
  syscallEventDrops:
    actions:
      - log

    maxBurst: 10

  # A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
  # rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
  # options:
  #  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
  #    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
  #  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
  #
  # With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
  # an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
  # afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
  # no activity.
