A Kubernetes controller to watch changes in ConfigMap and Secrets and then restart pods for Deployment, StatefulSet and DaemonSet

[![Get started with Stakater](https://stakater.github.io/README/stakater-github-banner.png)](http://stakater.com/?utm_source=Reloader&utm_medium=github)

## Problem

We would like to watch if some change happens in `ConfigMap` and/or `Secret`; then perform a rolling upgrade on relevant `Deployment`, `Deamonset` and `Statefulset`

## Solution

Reloader can watch changes in `ConfigMap` and `Secret` and do rolling upgrades on Pods with their associated `Deployments`, `Deamonsets` and `Statefulsets`.

## How to use Reloader

### Configmap

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `ConfigMap` called `foo-configmap`. Then add this annotation to main metadata of your `Deployment`

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo-configmap"
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
```

Use comma separated list to define multiple configmaps.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo-configmap,bar-configmap,baz-configmap"
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
```

### Secret

For a `Deployment` called `foo` have a `Secret` called `foo-secret`. Then add this annotation to main metadata of  your `Deployment`

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo-secret"
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
```

Use comma separated list to define multiple secrets.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    secret.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "foo-secret,bar-secret,baz-secret"
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
```

## Deploying to Kubernetes

You can deploy Reloader by following methods:

### Helm Charts

if you have configured helm on your cluster, you can add reloader to helm from public chart repository and deploy it via helm using below mentioned commands

 ```bash
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/

helm repo update

helm install stable/reloader
```

**Note:**  By default reloader watches in all namespaces. To watch in single namespace, please run following command. It will install reloader in `test` namespace which will only watch `Deployments`, `Deamonsets` and `Statefulsets` in `test` namespace.

```bash
helm install stable/reloader --set reloader.watchGlobally=false --namespace test
```
