# Ark-server

This helm chart installs Ark version v0.10.1
https://github.com/heptio/ark/tree/v0.10.1

## Upgrading to v0.10

Ark v0.10.1 introduces breaking changes. The below instructions are based on the [official upgrade guide](https://github.com/heptio/ark/blob/master/docs/upgrading-to-v0.10.md).

1. Pull the latest changes in this chart. If you're using Helm dependencies, update the chart version you're using in your `requirements.yaml` and run `helm dependency update`.

2. Scale down

```sh
kubectl scale -n heptio-ark deploy/ark --replicas 0
```

3. Migrate file structure of your backup storage according to [guide](https://github.com/heptio/ark/blob/master/docs/storage-layout-reorg-v0.10.md)
4. Adjust your `values.yaml` to the new structure and naming
5. Upgrade your deployment

```sh
helm upgrade --force --namespace heptio-ark ark ./ark
```

## Prerequisites

### Secret for cloud provider credentials
Ark server needs an IAM service account in order to run, if you don't have it you must create it.
Please follow the official documentation: https://heptio.github.io/ark/v0.10.0/install-overview

Don't forget the step to create the secret
```
kubectl create secret generic cloud-credentials --namespace <ARK_NAMESPACE> --from-file cloud=credentials-ark
```

### Configuration
Please change the values.yaml according to your setup
