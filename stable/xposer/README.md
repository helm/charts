# Xposer

## Problem
We would like to watch for services running in our cluster; and create Ingresses and generate TLS certificates automatically

## Solution
Xposer can watch for all the services running in our cluster; Creates, Updates, Deletes Ingresses and uses certmanager to generate TLS certificates automatically based on some annotations.

## How to use Xposer

### Config
The default config of Xposer is located at /configs/config.yaml

```
domain: stakater.com
ingressURLTemplate: "{{.Service}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}"
ingressURLPath: /
ingressNameTemplate: "{{.Service}}"
tls: false
```

Each property is explained below in details

For Xposer to  work on your service, it must have a label "expose = true"

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
```

### Kubernetes

#### Ingresses

Xposer reads the following annotations from a service
```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    xposer.stakater.com/annotations: |-
       firstAnnotation : abc
       secondAnnotation: abc
       thirdAnnotation: abc
```
xposer.stakater.com/annotations accepts annotations in new line. All the annotations provided here will be forwarded to Ingress as it is.

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressNameTemplate: "{{.Service}}-{{.Namespace}}"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLTemplate: "{{.Service}}.{{.Domain}}"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLPath: "/"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/Domain: domain.com
    config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS: "true"
```
The above 5 annotations are used to generate Ingress, if not provided default annotations from /configs/config.yaml will be used. 3 variables used are:
1. {{.Service}} = Name of the service which is created/updated
2. {{.Namespace}} = Namespace in which Xposer is running
3. {{.Domain}} = Default domain from /configs/config.yaml file. Can be changed there.

The above 5 annotations are for the following purpose:

1. config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressNameTemplate: With this annotation we can templatize generated Ingress Name. We can use the following template variables as well {{.Service}}, {{.Namespace}}. Can not include domain in Ingress name.

2. config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLTemplate: With this annotation we can templatize generated Ingress URL/Hostname. We can use all 3 variables to templatize it

3. config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLPath: With this annotation we can specify Ingress Path

4. config.xposer.stakater.com/Domain: With this annotation we can specify domain

5. config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS: With this annotation we can specify wether to use certmanager and generate a TLS certificate or not

#### Certmanager

First of all you need to install certmanager, and a Issuer/ClusterIssuer in your cluster. Xposer only needs 2 annotations to generate TLS certificates

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    xposer.stakater.com/annotations: |-
       certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer: your-cluster-issuer-name
    config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS: "true"
```
The above example use cluster issuer "certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer:" annotation which will be forwaded to the ingress as it is with the installed issuer/cluster issuer name. 

The second annotation "config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS:" tells Xposer to add TLS information to the Ingress so it can communicate with the certmanager to generate certificates

### Openshift

Support for openshift routes will be added soon

## TL;DR;

```bash
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
helm repo update
helm install stable/xposer
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
helm install --name my-release stable/xposer
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes nearly all the Kubernetes components associated with the
chart and deletes the release.

## Usage

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the chart and its default values.
