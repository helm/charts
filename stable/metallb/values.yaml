# Default values for metallb.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# To configure MetalLB, you must specify ONE of the following two
# options.

# existingConfigMap specifies the name of an externally-defined
# ConfigMap to use as the configuration. Helm will not manage the
# contents of this ConfigMap, it is your responsibility to create it.
existingConfigMap: metallb-config

# configInline specifies MetalLB's configuration directly, in yaml
# format. When configInline is used, Helm manages MetalLB's
# configuration ConfigMap as part of the release, and
# existingConfigMap is ignored.
#
# Refer to https://metallb.universe.tf/configuration/ for
# available options.
