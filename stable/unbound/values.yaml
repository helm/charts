# clusterIP:

# Controls which IP address ranges unbound will allow queries from.
# If you want to use unbound as an upstream for kube-dns, or allow other pods
# to query the resolver directly, you'll at least need to allow the
# clusterIpV4Cidr range.

# allowedIpRanges:
# - "10.10.10.10/20"

# You can set as many forward zones as needed by specifying the zone name
# and forward hosts. Forward hosts can be set by hostname or ip.

# forwardZones:
# - name: "fake.net"
#   forwardHosts:
#   - "fake1.host.net"
#   forwardIps:
#   - "10.10.10.10"

# Unbound can store DNS records in a "local zone." This facility can be used to
# assign context-specific names to a given IP address, and could also be used for
# private DNS if you don't want or have an external resolver.

# localRecords:
# - name: "fake3.host.net"
#   ip: "10.12.10.10"
