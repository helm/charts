  ## The following options specify the Role or ClusterRole to assign to the
  ## tiller service account. The ClusterRole "admin" is usually pre-defined in
  ## RBAC-enabled clusters and will allow administration of a namespace by
  ## whatever users or ServiceAccounts are bound to it in that same namespace.
  ## THERE IS SELDOM ANY REASON TO OVERRIDE THIS!!!
  role:
    ## Valid values are "Role" or "ClusterRole"
    type: ClusterRole
    name: admin

  ## Security options. The default values close known attack vectors.
  ## ALTER THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!

  ## Note that these tight restrictions do NOT impede normal use of Helm. Helm
  ## is always usable with any Tiller as long as the Helm user has permission to
  ## tunnel into pods in that Tiller's namespace.
  ## (Helm does this automatically.)

  ## Specify whether to include a service of type ClusterIP for Tiller
  includeService: false

  ## Specify whether Tiller pods should listen to 0.0.0.0 or just localhost
  onlyListenOnLocalhost: true

  ## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  ## choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  ## resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  ## lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  resources: {}
    # limits:
    #  cpu: 100m
    #  memory: 128Mi
    # requests:
    #  cpu: 100m
    #  memory: 128Mi

  nodeSelector: {}

  tolerations: []

  affinity: {}

## Optional additional ServiceAccounts
serviceAccounts:
- some-service-account
- another-service-account

## Optional additional RoleBindings. It is a good idea to specify at least one
## to grant administrative permissions to a user or group.
# roleBindings:
# - name: admin-group-admin
#   role:
#     ## Valid values are "Role" or "ClusterRole"
#     kind: ClusterRole
#     name: admin
#   subject:
#     ## Valid values are "User", "Group", or "ServiceAccount"
#     kind: Group
#     name: <group>
