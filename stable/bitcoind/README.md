# Bitcoind

[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/) uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;
managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a single node Bitcoin deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.
Docker image was taken from [Bitcoind for Docker](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-bitcoind) - many thanks!

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.8+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release stable/bitcoind
```

The command deploys bitcoind on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.
The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the bitcoind chart and their default values.

Parameter                  | Description                        | Default
-----------------------    | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------
`image.repository`         | Image source repository name       | `kuberstack/bitcoind`
`image.tag`                | `bitcoind` release tag.            | `0.15.1`
`image.pullPolicy`         | Image pull policy                  | `IfNotPresent`
`service.rpcPort`          | RPC port                           | `8332`
`service.p2pPort`          | P2P port                           | `8333`
`service.testnetPort`      | Testnet port                       | `18332`
`service.testnetP2pPort`   | Testnet p2p ports                  | `18333`
`service.selector`         | Node selector                      | `tx-broadcast-svc`
`persistence.enabled`      | Create a volume to store data      | `true`
`persistence.accessMode`   | ReadWriteOnce or ReadOnly          | `ReadWriteOnce`
`persistence.size`         | Size of persistent volume claim    | `300Gi`
`resources`                | CPU/Memory resource requests/limits| `{}`
`configurationFile`        | Config file ConfigMap entry        |

For more information about Bitcoin configuration please see [Bitcoin.conf_Configuration_File](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin#Bitcoin.conf_Configuration_File).

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/bitcoind
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Persistence

The bitcoind image stores the Bitcoind node data (Blockchain and wallet) and configurations at the `/bitcoin` path of the container.

By default a PersistentVolumeClaim is created and mounted into that directory. In order to disable this functionality
you can change the values.yaml to disable persistence and use an emptyDir instead.

> *"An emptyDir volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a Node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. When a Pod is removed from a node for any reason, the data in the emptyDir is deleted forever."*

!!! WARNING !!!

Please NOT use emptyDir for production cluster! Your wallets will be lost on container restart!

## Customize bitcoind configuration file

```yaml
configurationFile:
  bitcoind.conf: |-
    server=1
    printtoconsole=1
    rpcuser=rpcuser
    rpcpassword=rpcpassword
```
