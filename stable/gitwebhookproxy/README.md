A proxy to let webhooks to reach a Jenkins instance running behind a firewall

## PROBLEM

Jenkins is awesome and matchless tool for both CI & CD; but unfortunately its a gold mine if left in wild with wide open access; so, we always want to put it behind a firewall. But when we put it behind firewall then webhooks don't work anymore and no one wants the pull based polling but rather prefer the build to start as soon as there is a commit!

## SOLUTION

This little proxy makes webhooks start working again!

### Supported Providers

Currently we support the following git providers out of the box:

* Github
* Gitlab

### Configuration

GitWebhookProxy can be configured by providing the following arguments either via command line or via environment variables:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                       | Default  | Example                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|

| upstreamURL   |          URL to which the proxy requests will be forwarded (required)             |          | `https://someci-instance-url.com/webhook/` |
| secret        | Secret of the Webhook API. If not set validation is not made.  |                  | `iamasecret` |
| provider      | Git Provider which generates the Webhook                                          | `github` | `github` or `gitlab`                       |
| allowedPaths  | Comma-Separated String List of allowed paths on the proxy                         |          | `/project` or `github-webhook/,project/`   |
