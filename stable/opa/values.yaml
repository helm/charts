# Default values for opa.
# -----------------------
#
# The 'opa' key embeds an OPA configuration file. See
# https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/configuration.html for more details.
# Default value is no default config. For custom config, the opa key
# needs to include the opa config yaml, eg:
opa:
  services:
    controller:
      url: 'https://www.openpolicyagent.org'
  bundles:
    quickstart:
      service: controller
      resource: /bundles/helm-kubernetes-quickstart
  default_decision: /helm_kubernetes_quickstart/main
