maxClientConnections: 60
# Limits the number of concurrent connections (at the socket level) that a single client,
# identified by IP address, may make to a single member of the ZooKeeper ensemble.
# This is used to prevent certain classes of DoS attacks, including file descriptor exhaustion.
# The default is 10. Setting this to 0 entirely removes the limit on concurrent connections.
maxSessionTimeout: 40000
# New in 3.3.0: the maximum session timeout in milliseconds that the server will allow the client to negotiate. Defaults to 20 times the tickTime.
minSessionTimeout: 4000
# New in 3.3.0: the minimum session timeout in milliseconds that the server will allow the client to negotiate. Defaults to 2 times the tickTime.
tickTime: 2000
# the length of a single tick, which is the basic time unit used by ZooKeeper, as measured in milliseconds. It is used to regulate heartbeats, and timeouts.
# For example, the minimum session timeout will be two ticks.
purgeInterval: 12
initLimit: 10
# Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to connect and sync to a leader.
# Increased this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by ZooKeeper is large.
syncLimit: 5
# Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to sync with ZooKeeper. If followers fall too far behind a leader, they will be dropped.
