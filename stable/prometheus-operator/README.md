# prometheus-operator

Installs [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) to create/configure/manage Prometheus clusters atop Kubernetes.

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm install stable/prometheus-operator
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.  The chart can be installed multiple times to create separate Prometheus instances managed by Prometheus Operator.

## Prerequisites
  - Kubernetes 1.10+ with Beta APIs
  - Helm 2.10+ (For a workaround using an earlier version see [below](#helm-210-workaround))

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install --name my-release stable/prometheus-operator
```

The command deploys prometheus-operator on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

The default installation includes Prometheus Operator, Alertmanager, Grafana, and configuration for scraping Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

CRDs created by this chart are not removed by default and should be manually cleaned up:

```
kubectl delete crd prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
kubectl delete crd alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com
```

## Configuration

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the prometheus-operator chart and their default values.

## Helm <2.10 workaround
The `crd-install` hook is required to deploy the prometheus operator CRDs before they are used. If you are forced to use an earlier version of Helm you can work around this requirement as follows:
1. Install prometheus-operator by itself, disabling everything but the prometheus-operator component, and also setting `prometheusOperator.serviceMonitor.selfMonitor=false`
2. Install all the other components, and configure `prometheus.additionalServiceMonitors` to scrape the prometheus-operator service.
