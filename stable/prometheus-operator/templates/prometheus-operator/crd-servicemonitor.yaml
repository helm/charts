                  description: matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single
                    {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element
                    of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is
                    "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements
                    are ANDed.
