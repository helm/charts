*******************
*** DEPRECATED ****
*******************
* stable/prometheus-operator chart is deprecated.
* Further development has moved to https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts
* The chart has been renamed kube-prometheus-stack to more clearly reflect
* that it installs the `kube-prometheus` project stack, within which Prometheus
* Operator is only one component.

The Prometheus Operator has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl --namespace {{ template "prometheus-operator.namespace" . }} get pods -l "release={{ $.Release.Name }}"

Visit https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator for instructions on how
to create & configure Alertmanager and Prometheus instances using the Operator.
