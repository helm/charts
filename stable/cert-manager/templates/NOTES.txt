cert-manager has been deployed successfully!

In order to begin issuing certificates, you will need to set up a ClusterIssuer
or Issuer resource (for example, by creating a 'letsencrypt-staging' issuer).

More information on the different types of issuers and how to configure them
can be found in our documentation:

https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/tree/v0.2.3/docs/api-types/issuer

For information on how to configure cert-manager to automatically provision
Certificates for Ingress resources, take a look at the `ingress-shim`
documentation:

https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/v0.2.3/docs/user-guides/ingress-shim.md
