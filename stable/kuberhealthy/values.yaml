# Please remember that changing the service type to LoadBalancer
# will expose Kuberhealthy to the internet, which could cause
# error messages shown by Kuberhealthy to be exposed to the
# public internet.  It is recommended to create the service
# with ClusterIP, then to manually edit the service in order to
# securely expose the port in an appropriate way for your
# specific environment.
