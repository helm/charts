    ## Maximum permitted size in bytes of an unzipped request accepted by the server to be processed.

    ## Maximum number of requests permitted to be sent to the server concurrently.

    ## Authorization token to be checked. If a token is set here the agents must
    ## send their token in the following format: Authorization: Bearer <secret-token>.

      ## A value of 0 (the default) ensures events are immediately available
      ## to be sent to the outputs.

      ## Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
      ## if the number of events stored in the queue is < min_flush_events.

resources: {}
  ## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  ## choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  ## resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  ## lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 200Mi
