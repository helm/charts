The dmarc2logstash application has been deployed. If the pod enounters crash-
looping you might have missed the step to set the POP3 secrets. Review the 
chart's README.md for more information.

If successfully configured to reach the POP3 account containing the DMARC
reports, and if filebeat is successfully connecting to your logstash service, 
then you are ready to start reviewing the DMARC data in Kibana. 

Optionally, if you use Grafana for visualizations, consider importing the DMARC
dashboard, available in the https://github.com/jertel/dmarc2logstash project.

NOTE: The logstash.host and logstash.port values must be correctly defined in order for this deployment to be created. By default, no logstash service endpoint is provided.

Additionally, the POP3 secrets must be applied so that the application can login to the POP3 host.
