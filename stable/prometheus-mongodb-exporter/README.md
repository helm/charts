# Prometheus MongoDB Exporter

Installs the [MongoDB Exporter](https://github.com/percona/mongodb_exporter) for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). The
MongoDB Exporter collects and exports oplog, replica set, server status, sharding and storage engine metrics.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm upgrade --install my-release stable/prometheus-mongodb-exporter
```

This command deploys the MongoDB Exporter with the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Using the Chart

To use the chart, ensure the `mongodb.uri` is populated with a valid [MongoDB URI](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string).
If the MongoDB server requires authentication, credentials should be populated in the connection string as well. The MongoDB Exporter supports 
connecting to either a MongoDB replica set member, shard, or standalone instance.

The chart comes with a ServiceMonitor for use with the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator).
If you're not using the Prometheus Operator, you can disable the ServiceMonitor by setting `serviceMonitor.enabled` to `false` and instead
populate the `service.annotations` as below:

```yaml
service:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9216"
```
