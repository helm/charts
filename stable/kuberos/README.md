# Kuberos OIDC Helper

This is a config snippet generator for a k8s cluster

## TL;DR;
Sorry you will need to look at the [configuration](#configuration) values below for this one.

```console
$ helm install incubator/kuberos -f custom-values.yaml
```

## Warning
The config snippets that are generated from this chart include OIDC connection details in clear text.
These include content that would normally be in secrets.

## Introduction
This chart deploys the [kuberos](https://github.com/negz/kuberos) code
snippet generator for clusters using both
* OIDC - OpenID Connect, an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0
* RBAC - Role Based Access Controlls (in your k8s cluster)

It provides a quick and easy way for an authenticated user to generate
and download config for kubectl.

This work is [inspired from step 7 of the work](https://medium.com/@noqcks/secure-your-kubernetes-cluster-with-google-oidc-e1905c923522)
@noqcks did using other tooling.


## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes 1.8+ with RBAC enabled
- An OIDC provider eg G Suite
- RBAC on your cluster configured to use OIDC

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the kuberos chart

## Config params which probably need changing
These ones will be site specific and may contain sensitive information

### Other Config params can be left alone

In some conditions you might want to set `image.tag` to `latest` and then `image.pullPolicy` to `Always`
this is generally advised against for stability reasons.

In general config params not listed above can be ignored / left alone.
The rest of the params are standard enough the google and other charts will be better at explaining them than me


## OIDC (Provider) Setup
You will need to obtain the OIDC details of the provider you need to use. This will contain the Issuer URL, Client ID and the Client Secret.
In the case of Google (The provider which was used when initially creating this) go to the [Developer / Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) console. You will need to add the ingress url to both
* *Authorised JavaScript origins* - https://kuberos.example.com
* *Authorised redirect URIs* - https://kuberos.example.com/ui

If you used kops the credentials you're after are
```
apiVersion: kops/v1alpha2
kind: Cluster
  authorization:
    rbac: {}
  kubeAPIServer:
    authorizationRbacSuperUser: admin
    oidcClientID: UNIQUE_ID_REDACTED.apps.googleusercontent.com
    oidcIssuerURL: https://accounts.google.com
    oidcUsernameClaim: email
```
For G Suite :
The redacted part of a ClientID is about 45 alphanumeric characters long (may also contain a hyphen or two)
The client secret will be about 25 alphanumeric chacters (may also contain a hyphen or two)
