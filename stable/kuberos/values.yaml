# You probably want to change the values under `kuberos` and `ingress`

# `kuberos` describes the config for the app
kuberos:
  oidcClientURL: https://accounts.google.com
  # `oidcClientURL` is the endpoint that is used to quesry OIDC info
  oidcClientID: REDACTED.apps.googleusercontent.com
  # `oidcClientID` is typically a long alpha numeric string.
  #   For G Suite the 'REDACTED' part is about 45 alphanumeric characters
  oidcSecret: super-secret-value-here
  # `oidcSecret` is typically a long alpha numeric string.
  #   For G Suite it's about 25 alphanumeric characters
  #   For security reasons it's best to set this at deployment time with
  #     `--set kuberos.oidcSecret=mySuper-secretPassPhrase`
  clusters:
  # The clusters below must all use the same OIDC details above
  #   The config snippet that is generated for a user will default
  #   to the first cluster
  - name: dev-cluster
    # `name` is a label to apply to the cluster. It would normally be
    #   the fqdn of the cluster eg dev-cluster.example.com
    #   it can be something a little more friendly eg dev-cluster
    apiServer: https://api.dev-cluster.example.com
    # `apiServer` is the url for kubectl
    #   This is typically  https://api.fqdn
    caCrt: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      cert data here
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    # `caCrt` is the public / CA cert for the cluster

ingress:
  enabled: false
  # Set `enabled` to true to create an ingress and get external traffic to kuberos
  annotations: {}
  # Add your ingress annotations here. Most common ones are given below
    # kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    # certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer:      prod-acme
    # certmanager.k8s.io/acme-challenge-type: http01
    # nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: true
  path: /
  # `path` can stay as-is

  # Add host headers and cert names below
    - chart-example.local
  tls: []
  #  - secretName: chart-example-tls
  #    hosts:
