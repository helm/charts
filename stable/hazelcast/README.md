# DEPRECATED - Hazelcast

[Hazelcast IMDG](http://hazelcast.com/) is the most widely used in-memory data grid with hundreds of thousands of installed clusters around the world. It offers caching solutions ensuring that data is in the right place when itâ€™s needed for optimal performance.

## This Helm chart is deprecated

**Given the [stable deprecation timeline](https://github.com/helm/charts#deprecation-timeline), the Hazelcast IMDG Helm chart is now located at [hazelcast/charts](https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/).**

**The Hazelcast IMDG chart repo is also avaliable at [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/hazelcast/hazelcast).**

To install new chart, you just need to add the related repo and use `hazelcast/hazelcast` instead of `stable/hazelcast` as a chart name.

```bash
$ helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
$ helm install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast           # Helm 3
$ helm install --name my-release hazelcast-hazelcast   # Helm 2
```

## Quick Start

    $ helm install my-release stable/hazelcast        # Helm 3
    $ helm install --name my-release stable/hazelcast # Helm 2

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker/tree/master/hazelcast-kubernetes) and [Management Center](https://github.com/hazelcast/management-center-docker) deployments on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

-   Kubernetes 1.9+

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

    $ helm install my-release stable/hazelcast        # Helm 3
    $ helm install --name my-release stable/hazelcast # Helm 2

The command deploys Hazelcast on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

    $ helm delete my-release

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Hazelcast chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value,key=value` argument to `helm install`. For example,

    # Helm 3
    $ helm install my-release \
      --set cluster.memberCount=3 \
        stable/hazelcast

    # Helm 2
    $ helm install --name my-release \
      --set cluster.memberCount=3 \
        stable/hazelcast

The above command sets number of Hazelcast members to 3.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

    $ helm install my-release -f values.yaml stable/hazelcast        # Helm 3
    $ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/hazelcast # Helm 2

> **Tip**: You can use the default values.yaml

## Custom Hazelcast configuration

Custom Hazelcast configuration can be specified inside `values.yaml`, as the `hazelcast.yaml` property.

    hazelcast:
       yaml:
        hazelcast:
          network:
            join:
              multicast:
                enabled: false
              kubernetes:
                enabled: true
                service-name: ${serviceName}
                namespace: ${namespace}
                resolve-not-ready-addresses: true
            <!-- Custom Configuration Placeholder -->

# Notable changes

## 2.8.0

Hazelcast REST Endpoints are no longer enabled by default and the parameter `hazelcast.rest` is no longer available. If you want to enable REST, please add the related `endpoint-groups` to the Hazelcast Configuration. For example:

    rest-api:
      enabled: true
      endpoint-groups:
        HEALTH_CHECK:
          enabled: true
        CLUSTER_READ:
          enabled: true
        CLUSTER_WRITE:
          enabled: true
