This version of the kiam Helm chart is deprecated.
All future updates should be instead made to the uSwitch-hosted Helm chart,
located at https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/tree/master/helm/kiam.

To verify that kiam has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods -l "app={{ template "kiam.name" . }},release={{ .Release.Name }}"

Step1 : Add an annotation to your namespace as below:
~~~
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: iam-example
  annotations:
    iam.amazonaws.com/permitted: “<Role ARN or a Regex matching role ARN(s)>”
~~~
Step 2 :  Add an `iam.amazonaws.com/role` annotation to your pods with the role you want them to assume.
Use `curl` to verify the pod's role from within:

  curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
