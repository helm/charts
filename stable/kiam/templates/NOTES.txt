To verify that kiam has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods -l "app={{ template "kiam.name" . }},release={{ .Release.Name }}"

Add an `iam.amazonaws.com/role` annotation to your pods with the role you want them to assume.
Use `curl` to verify the pod's role from within:

  curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
