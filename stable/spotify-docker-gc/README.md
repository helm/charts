# Spotify's Docker-GC Helm Chart

This chart wraps the [spotify/docker-gc][] Docker image in the form of a [DaemonSet][], so that Docker resource garbage collection occurs on all nodes of a given Kubernetes cluster.

## Chart Details
This chart will do the following:

* Deploy one pod running the [spotify/docker-gc][] container to each node in a Kubernetes cluster, configured with the values provided.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release stable/spotify-docker-gc
```

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Spotify Docker GC chart and their default values.

See the [spotify/docker-gc GitHub repository][] for more settings which may be added to this chart as needed.

## Design/Evolution

The initial approach for wrapping [spotify/docker-gc][] in a Helm chart was to use a [CronJob][].  However, as of this writing, there is [no native support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36601) for [DaemonSet][]-like behavior -- that is, ensuring [Job][]s spawned by a given [CronJob][] run on all nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.  Once this feature has been implemented and the [CronJob][] resource itself stabilizes (it is currently in alpha), conversion to this resource would be prudent and will simplify the template/logic.

With regard to the [DaemonSet][] resource, do note that only in Kubernetes version >= 1.6 are pods automatically redeployed via [Rolling Update](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/22543) when the [DaemonSet][] itself is changed (e.g., via a `helm upgrade`).
