The Elastabot application has been deployed. If the pod enounters crash-
looping you might have missed the step to set the Slack secrets. Review the 
chart's README.md for more information.

If successfully configured to reach the Slack community with the specific bot token,
and if Elastabot is successfully connecting to your Elasticsearch service, 
then you are ready to start communicating with the bot. Send the bot !help to see 
usage instructions in Slack.

Warning: Elastabot is not usable in the current configuration state.

The elasticsearch.host and elasticsearch.port values must be correctly defined
in order for this deployment to be created. By default, no Elasticsearch service
endpoint is provided.

Additionally, the Slack secrets must be applied so that the application can connect
to Slack as a bot.
