  # When enabling LDAP or another non-Jenkins identity source, the built-in admin account will no longer exist.
  # Since the AdminUser is used by configAutoReload, in order to use configAutoReload you must change the

  # to have administrator rights in Jenkins (the default Overall:Read is sufficient) nor will it be granted any
  # additional rights.  Failure to do this will cause the sidecar container to fail to authenticate via SSH and enter
  # a restart loop.  Likewise if you disable the non-Jenkins identity store and instead use the Jenkins internal one,
  # you should revert Master.AdminUser to your preferred admin user:
  AdminUser: admin
  # AdminPassword: <defaults to random>

  # If CasC auto-reload is enabled, an SSH (RSA) keypair is needed.  Can either provide your own, or leave unconfigured to allow a random key to be auto-generated.

  # Below is the implementation of Jenkins Configuration as Code.  Add a key under ConfigScripts for each configuration area,
  # where each corresponds to a plugin or section of the UI.  Each key (prior to | character) is just a label, and can be any value.
  # Keys are only used to give the section a meaningful name.  The only restriction is they may only contain RFC 1123 \ DNS label
  # characters: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.  The keys become the name of a configuration yaml file on the master in
  # /var/jenkins_home/casc_configs (by default) and will be processed by the Configuration as Code Plugin.  The lines after each |
  # become the content of the configuration yaml file.  The first line after this is a JCasC root element, eg jenkins, credentials,
  # etc.  Best reference is https://<jenkins_url>/configuration-as-code/reference.  The example below creates a welcome message:
  JCasC:
    enabled: false

    SupportPluginVersion: 1.5
