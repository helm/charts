  ## Artifactory requires a unique master key
  ## You can generate one with the command:
  ## 'openssl rand -hex 32'
  ## Pass it to helm with '--set artifactory.masterKey=${MASTER_KEY}'
  ## IMPORTANT: You should NOT use the example masterKey for a production deployment!
  masterKey: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

  ## Artifactory license secret.
  ## If artifactory.license.secret is passed, it will be mounted as
  ## ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/artifactory.cluster.license and loaded at run time.
  ## The dataKey should be the name of the secret data key created.
