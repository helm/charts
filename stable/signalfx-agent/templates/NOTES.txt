The SignalFx agent is being deployed in your Kubernetes cluster.  You should
see metrics flowing once the agent image is downloaded and started (this may
take a few minutes since it has to download the agent container image).

Assuming you are logged into SignalFx in your browser, visit

https://app.signalfx.com/#/navigator/kubernetes%20pods/kubernetes%20pods

to see all of the pods in your cluster.
