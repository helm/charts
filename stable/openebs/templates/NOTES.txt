The OpenEBS has been installed. Check its status by running:
$ kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

For dynamically creating OpenEBS Volumes, you can either create a new StorageClass or
use one of the default storage classes provided by OpenEBS.

Use `kubectl get sc` to see the list of installed OpenEBS StorageClasses. A sample
PVC spec using `openebs-jiva-default` StorageClass is given below:"

---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo-vol-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: openebs-jiva-default
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5G
---

Please note that, OpenEBS uses iSCSI for connecting applications with the
OpenEBS Volumes and your nodes should have the iSCSI initiator installed.
