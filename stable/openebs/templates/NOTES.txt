The OpenEBS has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

For dynamically creating OpenEBS Volumes, you will need to create StorageClass. 

OpenEBS Storage class can be created using the following spec:
---
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
   name: openebs-standard
provisioner: openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
parameters:
  openebs.io/storage-pool: "default"
  openebs.io/jiva-replica-count: "3"
  openebs.io/volume-monitor: "true"
  openebs.io/capacity: 5G
---

And use this storage class "openebs-standard" in your PVC as shown below:
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo-vol-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: openebs-standard
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 4G
---

Please note that, OpenEBS uses iSCSI for connecting applications with the 
OpenEBS Volumes and your nodes should have the iSCSI initiator installed.
