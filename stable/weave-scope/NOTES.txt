After installing a Scope frontend and node agents, access the frontend 
in your web browser.  If you used this chart to install the frontend, 
it can be accessed in the following ways:

1) Using `kubectl port-forward` directly to the frontend pod

2) Using an SSH or other port-forward through a cluster node to the 
   Service's address and port

3) (for a NodePort or LoadBalancer service) Using a node IP and the 
   Service's NodePort
   

4) (for a LoadBalancer service) Using the created load balancer's 
   external IP and port
