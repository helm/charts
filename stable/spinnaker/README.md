# Spinnaker Chart

[Spinnaker](http://spinnaker.io/) is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform.

## Chart Details
This chart will provision a fully functional and fully featured Spinnaker installation 
that can deploy and manage applications in the cluster that it is deployed to. 

Redis and Minio are used as the stores for Spinnaker state.

For more information on Spinnaker and its capabilities, see it's [documentation](http://www.spinnaker.io/docs).

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release stable/spinnaker
```

Note that this chart pulls in many different Docker images so can take a while to fully install. 

## Configuration

Configurable values are documented in the `values.yaml`.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/spinnaker
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Adding Kubernetes Clusters to Spinnaker

By default, installing the chart only registers the local cluster as a deploy target
for Spinnaker. If you want to add arbitrary clusters need to do the following:

1. Upload your kubeconfig to a secret with the key `config` in the cluster you are installing Spinnaker to.

    ```shell
    $ kubectl create secret generic --from-file=$HOME/.kube/config my-kubeconfig
    ```

1. Set the following values of the chart:

    ```yaml
    kubeConfig:
      enabled: true
      secretName: my-kubeconfig
      secretKey: config
      contexts:
      # Names of contexts available in the uploaded kubeconfig
      - my-context
    ```
