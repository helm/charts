# This file is intended to serve as a master configuration for a Spinnaker deployment.
# Customizations to the deployment should be made in another file named
# "spinnaker-local.yml". The distribution has a prototype called
# "default-spinnaker-local.yml" which calls out the subset of attributes of general
# interest. It can be copied into a "spinnaker-local.yml" to start with. The prototype
# does not change any of the default values here, it just surfaces the more critical
# attributes.
