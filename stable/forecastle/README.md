[![Get started with Stakater](https://stakater.github.io/README/stakater-github-banner.png)](http://stakater.com/?utm_source=IngressMonitorController&utm_medium=github)

## Problem(s)

- We would like to have a central place where we can easily look for and access our applications running on Kubernetes.
- We would like to have a tool which can dynamically discover and list the apps running on Kubernetes.
- A launchpad to access developer tools e.g. Jenkins, Nexus, Kibana, Grafana, etc.

## Solution

Forecastle gives you access to a control panel where you can see your running applications and access them on Kubernetes.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

You can deploy Forecastle helm charts. By default forecastle watches in all namespaces. If you want forecastle to watch only in specific namespaces, update the `values.yaml` and modify the `config.data.namespaces` key with a list of namespaces which you want Forecastle to watch.

### Helm Charts

If you configured `helm` on your cluster, you can deploy Forecastle via helm chart located using command


```yaml
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/

helm repo update

helm install stable/forecastle
```

## Configuration

Forecastle looks for a specific annotations on ingresses.

- Add the following annotations to your ingresses in order to be discovered by forecastle:

|           Annotation           |                                           Description                                           |
|:------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `forecastle.stakater.com/expose` | **[Required]** Add this with value `true` to the ingress of the app you want to show in Forecastle  |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/icon`   | **[Optional]** Icon/Image URL of the application; |
| `forecastle.stakater.com/appName`   | **[Optional]** Name of the application to be shown in forecastle |


## Usage
The following quickstart let's you set up forecastle quickly:

Update the `values.yaml` and set the following properties

| Key           | Description                                                               | Example                            | Default Value                      |
