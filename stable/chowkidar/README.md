[![Get started with Stakater](https://stakater.github.io/README/stakater-github-banner.png)](http://stakater.com/?utm_source=Chowkidar&utm_medium=github)

## WHY NAME CHOWKIDAR?
Chowkidar, an Urdu word, is used for Watchman in Pakistan. This Chowkidar will watch over your cluster, looking for any anomaly in the cluster and will act as you want it to.

## Problem
We would like to watch for relevant events happening inside kubernetes and then perform actions depending upon the criteria.
e.g. I would like to get a slack notification when a pod is submitted without requests & limits.

## Solution

Chowkidar allows you to have multiple controllers that will continuously watch types in all the namespaces and automatically perform any actions given in the yaml file. With this, you can easily check for any criteria on your Pods/other types and take corresponding actions.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

### Vanilla Manifests

You have to first clone or download the repository contents. The kubernetes deployment and files are provided inside `deployments/kubernetes/manifests` folder.

### Configuring

First of all you need to modify `configs/config.yaml` file. Following are the available options that you can use to customize the controllers:

| Key                   |Description                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type                  | The type of Resource you want to monitor, like Pods, Deployments, etc         |
| watchcriterion        | The criterion for which you want to take actions for the controller e.g. ResourceExists,etc     |
| actions               | The Array of actions that you want to take, e.g. send message to Slack, etc   |

### Supported Types
Currently we are supporting,
- Pods


We will be adding support for other Types as well in the future

### Supported Criterion
Currently we are supporting following Criterion
- resourceExists: It will make sure Pods should have Resources and if not found, it will take action


We will be adding support for other Criterion as well in the future

### Supported Actions
Currently we are supporting following Actions with their Parameters,
- Slack: you need to provide `token` and `Channel Name` as Parameters in the yaml file

We will be adding support for other Actions as well in the future

### Helm Charts

if you configured `helm` on your cluster, you can deploy Chowkidar via helm chart located under `deployments/kubernetes/chart/Chowkidar` folder.

 ```bash
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/

helm repo update

helm install stable/chowkidar
```
