### Ingress ###
# - Rancher Self-Signed (passthrough)
# The Default is to set passthrough so rancher uses its self-signed certs.
# Your web browser will complain, but Rancher will still work.
#
# ingress.tls=rancher
#
# - Public CA signed certs.
# If you have your own certs and a DNS entry, you can add the certs to the
# rancher-system namespace as the "tls-rancher" k8s secret.
#
# Combine server followed intermediate certs into tls.crt.
# Copy private key into tls.key.
# Use kubectl to create the secret
#
# kubectl -n rancher-system create secret generic tls-rancher \
# --from-file=tls.crt --from-file=tls.key
#
# hostname=your.domain.name.com
# ingress.tls=publicCA
#
# - Private CA signed certs
# You can add your own private CA signed certs. Create the secret like above but
# also add your CA Cert to `tls-rancher-server` secret.
#
# Copy the CA cert into a file named `cacerts.pem` and use `kubectl` to create
# the secret.
#
# kubectl -n rancher-system create secret generic tls-rancher-server \
# --from-file=cacerts.pem
#
# hostname=your.domain.name.com
# ingress.tls=privateCA
#
# - LetsEncrypt
# Lets Encrypt will require the Rancher Server(ingress) to be accessible from
# the internet and a Public DNS record that points to the Rancher Server.
#
# This will install stable/cert-manager to manage the ssl cert renewal.
#
# hostname=your.domain.name.com
# ingress.tls=letsEncrypt
# letsEncrypt.email=<your email>
# letsEncrypt.environment=<staging | prod>

ingress:

### LetsEncrypt config ###
# ProTip: The prod environment only allows you to register a name 5 times a week.
#         Use staging until you have your config right.
