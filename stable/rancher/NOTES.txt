# Connecting to Rancher

Rancher should now be accessible. Browse to `https://whatever.fqdn.is.set.to`

## Connecting to a `localhost` Rancher Server

By default Rancher is listening on `rancher.localhost` for connections. This default is handy if you want to run it on your local workstation. You will need to set up a `hosts` entry to connect.

* Windows - `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`
* Mac - `/etc/hosts`

127.0.0.1 rancher.local

Then browse to https://rancher.localhost
