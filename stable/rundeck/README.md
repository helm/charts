# Rundeck Helm chart
This chart would install Rundeck in kubernetes cluster. Rundeck is open source software that helps automating routine operational procedures in data center or cloud environments. For more details on Rundeck, please refer [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org).
Chart supports persistent shared store for storing rundeck project related files. It also supports external DB to store various jobs and their logs.
## Prerequisite
Kubernetes 1.9+
Secret with name **rundeck-ssh** should exist in the k8s cluster which should use private key for remote edge nodes passwordless connection.
```
kubectl create secret generic rundeck-ssh --from-file=id_rsa=<private key file name>
```
If external database is configured, then empty database should be available and DB related options inside values.yaml need to be configured accordingly.
## Installing the chart

```
helm install --name rundeck .
```

## Accessing Rundeck after installation
Once chart is installed with default values.yaml, Rundeck service can be accessed using below url. URL can be customized in values.yaml. Rundeck also exposes API endpoint which can be integrated with any application needing operational support provided by Rundeck using /api endpoint.
```
http://rundeck.default.svc.cluster.local
```

## Special Note
Chart can be run in minikube. We need to enable ingress and add minikube ip in host file(inside /etc/hosts in Linux and C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc in Windows) of the environment where we want to access Rundeck UI endpoint through ingress.

## Options in values.yaml
Default Values are specified in values.yaml. They can be customized as per user needs.
