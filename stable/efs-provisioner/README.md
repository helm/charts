# Helm chart for 'efs-provisioner'

The Kubernetes project provides an AWS [EFS provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/aws/efs)
that is used to fulfill PersistentVolumeClaims with EFS PersistentVolumes.

"The efs-provisioner allows you to mount EFS storage as PersistentVolumes in kubernetes.
It consists of a container that has access to an AWS EFS resource. The container reads
a configmap which contains the EFS filesystem ID, the AWS region and the name you want
to use for your efs-provisioner. This name will be used later when you create a storage class."

This chart deploys the EFS Provisioner and a StorageClass for EFS volumes (optionally as the default).

The EFS external storage provisioner runs in a Kubernetes cluster and will create persistent volumes
in response to the PersistentVolumeClaim resources being created. These persistent volumes can then be
mounted on containers.

  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/

The persisent volumes are created as folders with in an AWS EFS filesystem.

## DEPRECATION NOTICE

This chart is deprecated and no longer supported.

## Prequisites

You must create the EFS file system and end points yourself first.

  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/creating-using-create-fs.html

The end points must be accessible to the cluster and the cluster nodes must have
permission to mount EFS file systems.

## Configuring

At a minimum you must the supply the EFS file system ID and the AWS region

```
helm install stable/efs-provisioner --set efsProvisioner.efsFileSystemId=fs-12345678 --set efsProvisioner.awsRegion=us-east-2
```

All the values documented below and by `helm inspect values`.

```
helm inspect values stable/efs-provisioner
```

```
