  ## Since this is one volume, your access mode and size should be the size you
  ## will need for all of these folders. In general the size of this data is
  ## small since we store only the certificates and some extra data in the
  ## database as well as the users/admins PGP keys. It's highly recommended to
  ## seed the database with PGP keys from WKD as this has the smallest
  ## footprint, but note that some users may have rather large keys.
