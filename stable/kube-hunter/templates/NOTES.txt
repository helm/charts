A CronJob will run with schedule {{ .Values.cronjob.schedule }}, denoted in UTC.

It will keep {{ .Values.failedJobsHistoryLimit }} failed Job(s) and {{ .Values.successfulJobsHistoryLimit }} successful Job(s).
See the logs of the Pod associated to each Job to see result.

The Jobs will not be removed automagically when deleting this Helm chart.
To remove these jobs, run the following :

kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} delete job -l app={{ template "kube-hunter.name" . }},release={{ .Release.Name }}
