# Metacontroller

[metacontroller](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller) is an add-on for Kubernetes that makes it easy to write and deploy custom controllers. Although the open-source project was started at Google, the add-on works the same in any Kubernetes cluster.

While custom resources provide storage for new types of objects, custom controllers define the behavior of a new extension to the Kubernetes API. Just like the CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) API makes it easy to request storage for a custom resource, the Metacontroller APIs make it easy to define behavior for a new extension API or add custom behavior to existing APIs. (from Metacontroller [Website](https://metacontroller.app/))

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm install stable/metacontroller
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a metacontroller on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. This enables you to deploy custom controllers as service + deployment pairs (see [docs](https://metacontroller.app/guide/create/))

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install stable/metacontroller --name my-release
```

The command deploys metacontroller on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation. There is a high likelihood that you will want the default configuration.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```
or

```console
$ helm delete --purge my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the metacontroller chart and their default values.

Parameter | Description | Default
--- | --- | ---
`image.repository` | `metacontroller` image repository  | `metacontroller/metacontroller`
`image.tag` | `metacontroller` image tag  | `v0.3.0`
`rbac.create` | Specifies whether RBAC resources should be created | `true`

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
$ helm install stable/metacontroller --name my-release \
  --set=image.tag=0.2,resources.limits.cpu=200m
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install stable/metacontroller --name my-release -f values.yaml
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Notes
You can only install one copy of this chart in a given Kubernetes cluster, due to the fact that it has CRDs included in it. If you attempt to install a second copy, you'll get an error like so:

```console
Error: release my-release failed: customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "compositecontrollers.metacontroller.k8s.io" already exists
```
