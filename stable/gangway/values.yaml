gangway:
  # The address to listen on. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces.

  # httpPath: "https://${GANGWAY_HTTP_PATH}"

  # The key to use when encrypting the contents of cookies.
  # You can leave this blank and the chart will generate a random key, however
  # you must use that with caution. Subsequent upgrades to the deployment will
  # regenerate this key which will cause Gangway to error when attempting to
  # decrypt cookies stored in users' browsers which were encrypted with the old
  # key.
  # TL;DR: Safe to use the auto generation in test environments, provide your
  # own in procution.
