This Helm chart is deprecated

Given the [`stable` deprecation timeline](https://github.com/helm/charts#deprecation-timeline), the New Relic infrastructure integration chart is now located at [newrelic/helm-charts](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/).

New Relic will continue providing the same cadence of updates, support, etc that we've been keeping here these years. Installation instructions are very similar, just adding the _newrelic_ repo and using it during the installation (`newrelic/<chart>` instead of `stable/<chart>`)

```bash
$ helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
$ helm install my-release newrelic/<chart>           # Helm 3
$ helm install --name my-release newrelic/<chart>    # Helm 2
```

To update an exisiting _stable_ deployment with a chart hosted in the New Relic repository you can execute:

```bash
$ helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
$ helm upgrade my-release newrelic/<chart>
```

Issues and PRs related to the chart itself will be redirected to `newrelic/charts` GitHub repository.

New Relic is very thankful for all the 15+ community members that contributed and helped maintain this chart throughout the years.

Your deployment of the New Relic Infrastructure agent is complete. You can check on the progress of this by running the following command:

    kubectl get daemonset -o wide -w --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ template "newrelic.fullname" . }}
{{- else -}}

####       ERROR: You did not set a licenseKey and/or cluster name.       ####
##############################################################################

This deployment will be incomplete until you get your API key from New Relic.

Then run:

    helm upgrade {{ .Release.Name }} \
        --set licenseKey=YOUR-KEY-HERE \
        --set cluster=YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME \
        stable/newrelic-infrastructure

{{- end -}}
