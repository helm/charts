# Default values for the katafygio chart.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# gitUrl (optional) is a remote git repository that Katafygio can clone, and where
# it can push changes. If gitUrl is not defined, Katafygio will still maintain a
# pod-local git repository, which can be on a persistent volume (see above).
# gitUrl: https://user:token@github.com/myorg/myrepos.git

# noGit disable git versioning when true (will only keep an unversioned local dump up-to-date).
noGit: false

# healthcheckPort is the TCP port Katafygio will listen for health check requests.
healthcheckPort: 8080

# logLevel can be info, warning, error, or fatal.
logLevel: warning
# logOutput can be stdout, stderr, or syslog.
logOutput: stdout
# logServer (optional) provide the address of a remote syslog server.
# logServer: "localhost:514"

# filter is an (optional) label selector used to restrict backups to selected objects.
# filter: "app in (foo, bar)"

# excludeKind is an array of excluded (not backuped) Kubernetes objects kinds.
excludeKind:
  - replicaset
  - endpoints
  - event

# excludeObject is an array of specific Kubernetes objects to exclude from dumps
# (the format is: objectkind:namespace/objectname).
# excludeObject:
#  - "configmap:kube-system/leader-elector"

# resyncInterval is the interval (in seconds) between full catch-up resyncs
# (to catch possibly missed events). Set to 0 to disable resyncs.
resyncInterval: 300

# localDir is the path where we'll dump and commit cluster objects.
localDir: "/var/lib/katafygio/data"

# persistence for the localDir dump directory. Note that configuring gitUrl
# is an other way to achieve persistence.
